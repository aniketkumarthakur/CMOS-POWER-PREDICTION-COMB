# CMOS-POWER-PREDICTION
Power estimation in CMOS VLSI circuits is essential for optimizing performance, dynamic power management , reducing costs, and improving reliability . Accurately estimating power consumption remains a challenge due to circuit complexity and varying conditions.Here we will use Random Forest ML model to predict power
